# Black-Friday-sale-EDA-
* A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, citytype, stayincurrentcity), product details (productid and product category) and Total purchaseamount from last month.
* Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.
* Libraries used:-
1. Numpy
2. pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
* Conclusion:- 
In the Given dataset. I explored and learned many things like, How to fill NaN values. Where we can use the concept of code reusability. In the process of cleaning the dataset I used Pandas and Numpy libraries. Using pandas and numpy I removed unwanted(useless) data and created new data frames and got useful data for my research. After cleaning my data I used Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to read my data by visualizing it. I created questions regarding my research I tried to solve it by visualizing and applying conditions. Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products. By seeing this EDA we can fulfill this requirements.
